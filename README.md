This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

A Json API was created using (https://github.com/ajoelp/mock-json-server).

Every event is charaterized by a unique Id, date of start, date of finish and the content of the event.

An other project was fundamental for this uncompleted project , wich is react-agenda (https://github.com/Revln9/react-agenda/)

The previous work is taking the data from an existing object called items, I have added a code to import data from a Fake JSOn API and treat the data to render it in the page.

The calendar is of course responsive and using Bootstarp to adapt to diffirent screens.

To excute the program, we just have to: 
1.execute the Fake JSON server with this command: 'mock-json-server data.json'
2.install dependencies from package.json using this command: 'npm install'
3.execute the project using this command: 'npm start'

The project is far to be finished and is going to be completed asap.
Thank you for this opportunity to discover new features and practise more.
